# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm [Pháº¡m VÅ© ThÃ¡i Minh](https://thaiminhpv.tech/)

- I am 18 years old, as a final-year student at FPT University. I have studied
  at the University since I was 16. My interests are software development and
  machine learning.

- I love solving problems and building software that impacts people around me.
  I took part in some projects for communities by contributing to some
  non-profit organizations, namely ASAP Project (about psychology) and The 80%
  Project (about equality).

- Additionally, I have participated in several competitions, such as FPT Edu
  Hackathon 2021 and FPT Edu Hackathon 2019. Although I had to compete against
  other older competitors, I still received awards.

- I am currently looking for **internship opportunities** in the field of Machine
  Learning.
