Hi there, Iâ€™m Pham Vu Thai Minh ðŸ‘‹

- I am 18 years old, and I am a final-year student at FPT University. I began to
study at the university when I was 16. I am currently majoring in Software
Engineering with a strong interest in software development and machine
learning.

- I also participated in building some projects for communities. I have
contributed to some non-profit organizations, namely ASAP Project and The 80%
Project, which raises communitiesâ€™ awareness about equality, psychology, etc.

- Additionally, I participated in several competitions, such as FPT Edu Hackathon
2021 and FPT Edu Hackathon 2019, where I had to compete against other older
competitors, and I have received some awards.

- I am looking for internship opportunities in the field of Machine Learning. I
am interested in solving problems and building software that impacts people
around me.

- I am happy to connect with people and ready to make new friends.
