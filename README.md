# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm [Pháº¡m VÅ© ThÃ¡i Minh](https://thaiminhpv.github.io/)

- I began studying at the University when I was 16, got my first-authored Q1 journal article when I was 19, and graduated from my University when I was 20. My interests are deep learning and software development.

- I love solving problems and building software that impacts people around me. I have contributed to some non-profit/open-sourced organizations and communities such as **Hugging Face**, **Langchain**, **GPT4All**, ASAP Project (about psychology), 80% Project (about equality), Developh Vietnam, Japanese Software Engineers Club (teaching), and AWS Academy (educator).

- Additionally, I have participated and received awards in many competitions.
